Polargraph changelog.

2017-11-01
Re-package of same versions, now WITHOUT MacOS precompiled binary 
because of reports of virus (http://www.polargraph.co.uk/forum/polargraphs-group2/code-software-forum2/polargraph-controller-doing-mining-on-osx-thread642/).


2017-05-10
polargraphcontroller 2.4.2
* Expanded the serial port listing window.
* Added MacOS precompiled binary.

polargraph_firmware_polarshield 1.4
* Added autorun feature. Machine will automatically run a file on the SD card called autorun.txt on boot.


2016-03-29
polargraphcontroller 2.4.0
* Added: Feature to swap the POLYGONIZER style that Geomerative uses when dealing
with shapes. Currently only two are supported - UNIFORMLENGTH (1), which also uses a 
numberspinner to specify the actual uniform length, and ADAPTATIVE. Prior to v2.2.2,
polargraphcontroller used ADAPTATIVE, but http://www.polargraph.co.uk/forum/polargraphs-group2/troubleshooting-forum5/saw-tooth-circle-and-dubious-text-thread395/
prompted me to change it to UNIFORMLENGTH. But then http://www.polargraph.co.uk/forum/polargraphs-group2/troubleshooting-forum5/svg-differences-between-polargraphcontroller-2-1-1-2-3-0-thread523.0/#postid-3106
has prompted this more recent change. Horses for courses, right?
* Fixed: Zooming would always keep the machine origin fixed, so you'd have to
periodically grab and re-centre the preview machine. Now the position of the
mouse on the machine is the origin, and the machine zooms around it. Should have
always been like that.
* Fixed: Zooming speed did not scale. Now one "spin" on the wheel zooms
the same sized increment no matter the current zoom level.
* Found: Changing the window size by stretching the edges _does_ properly
reflow the buttons and enable them. Maximising the window does not. So 
manually roll the window out to the size you want, rather than maximising it
(Windows 10).

polargraph_firmware_polarshield 1.3.1
* Fixed: The pen lift height command was borked. Now unborked. Or at least,
borked in a more functional way.



2016-01-26
polargraphcontroller 2.3.0
* Added: Density preview is now posterized by default, and is linked to the
pen width setting. So should be able to use this to better visualise the link
between pen width and grid size. 
* Fixed: Queue preview bug: http://www.polargraph.co.uk/forum/polargraphs-group2/code-software-forum2/updated-controller-thread504.0/#postid-2938
thanks jbscribble.
* Fixed: Slight improvement in pixel rendering speed.

2016-01-24
Bundle:
* Added: Adafruit_MotorShield to the packaged arduino-source/libraries.

polargraphcontroller 2.2.2
* Added: The pixel density preview can now be posterized using a number 
spinner in the UI. This might be useful to visualise results when your 
dynamic range is compressed. Like when you're using a really small pixel, 
or a thick pen.

* Added: The console is back! But different. This might be useful but is only
intended as an interim solution. Ctrl-C for console. 
Partial solution to issue 8 (https://github.com/euphy/polargraphcontroller/issues/8)

* Fixed: The fix about motor defaults to be like PolargraphSD, mentioned in the 
previous version (2.1.1) actually has been fixed this time.

* No MacOS build in this package. I've got no way of doing those on-demand.

polargraph_server_a1 1.2.1
* Fixed: Compiles in Arduino IDE v1.6.6 and v1.6.7.

polargraph_server_polarshield 1.3
* Updated: The comms protocol used in the polargraph_server_a1 has been brought 
over to polarshield. It uses proper line endings instead of checksums. In theory
this is actually faster too, since it can 

* Fixed: Compiles in Arduino IDE v1.6.6 and v1.6.7.


2015-11-10
polargraphcontroller 2.1.1
* Fixed: The fit-machine-to-window sometimes backfires, and ends up with a
negative machine size. There is now something to catch that.
* Updated: Set default motor setup to be like PolargraphSD 
(200 steps / 8x stepMultiplier).

polargraph_server_polarshield 1.2.2
* Fixed: https://github.com/euphy/polargraph_server_polarshield/issues/8
Pen width is no longer "nan" after startup. This was an EEPROM loading issue.
* Updated: Visibility of "calibrate" button can be controlled by a boolean.
More suitable for general consumption.
* Fixed: Uncommented #USE_LCD so ... it uses the LCD touch. This might have
caused a lot of problems, so thanks to Erea for harrassing my into looking
more closely at it.
* Discovered: Doesn't work in Arduino IDE 1.6.6. DOES work in 1.6.5.

2015-10-25
polargraphcontroller 2.1.0
* Closed: https://github.com/euphy/polargraphcontroller/issues/6
A sloppy merge meant that the GCode importing feature did not make it to
the master branch from the Processing2 branch!
* Closed: https://github.com/euphy/polargraphcontroller/issues/5
Window resizing left some ControlP5 buttons impossible to activate.
* Updated: https://github.com/euphy/polargraphcontroller/issues/2
Machine scales to fit window vertically on startup.
* Added: Button (Cycle Preview Style) to cycle through the different pixel
density preview styles.
* Upgraded bundled ControlP5 library to v2.2.5 
(https://github.com/sojamo/controlp5/releases/tag/v2.2.5).
* Included MacOS binary kindly built by Rainer Killinger 
(https://github.com/abcdev).

2015-09-13
polargraphcontroller 2.0
Updated to run in Processing v2.2.1, with the modern versions of ControlP5
and Geomerative.  Functional differences are small, but the frame rate is 
now limited to be pretty low, so it no longer grabs and entire core of your
CPU and strangles it to the ground. It's more gentle.

Processing v2.2.1 apparently cannot export MacOS binaries any more (from
Windows), so either a Mac user can help me by sending me one compiled on
your machine, or Mac users will have to make do with the old version 
(packaged), or just run from source.

Though there have not been any intentional changes (beyond the frame rate
thing), Processing and ControlP5 have moved on a lot since v1.5, so I 
bet there will be breaking things. I haven't come across them yet, but 
consider this beta, and please let me know how you get on.

2015-07-18
polargraph_server_polarshield 1.2
Actually working this time. I'd left a little surprise in by accident.

2015-07-15
Changed bundle versioning system to be timestamp-based. This is because it 
contains different products, and each of the products could be on different 
versions. So it never really worked.

polargraph_server_polarshield 1.2
Updated code to compile in Arduino IDE v1.6x. This also meant updating the
UTFT library to v2.81.

2015-05-19
polargraphcontroller 1.2
Added ability to import g-code as a vector format. This works for the few
cases I have tried (stuff exported from inkscape, Dullbits' "death to sharpie"),
but I'm sure there's a world of edge cases that the simplistic parser does not 
handle well.

Added "Preview cord offset" feature. When you have a queue full of commands,
the controller shows you a preview of them. Change the "preview cord offset"
value to see what the drawing will look like if the cords are set up wrong.
The purpose of this is to help in troubleshooting. Not sure if it will yet.
Happy birthday, Kongo!

polargraph_server_a1 1.2
Have added MEGA as a compilation target, and added the features from the MEGA
branch into this codebase. For this reason, polargraph_server_mega is no 
longer included in the bundle.
Features are:
* SD card reading
* Norwegian pixel
* Spiral pixel
* Sprite drawing
And I'm sure there's other ones too. I've rejigged how the configuration is
done in the main .ino file, and it should be a bit harder to mess up now.
This is all a bit new, and I'm sure there will be issues. I only have about
half of the hardware I need to test it properly.

2014-10-05
polargraph_server_a1 1.10.6
Added SERIAL_STEPPER_DRIVER as a possible driver board. This is a shortcut
to using _a1 with generic driver modules like stepsticks, Pololu things, and
Easydrivers. Just set the pin numbers in the configuration.ino file.
Fixed a problem with "move to point" where only the first parameter was used.
Added a pixel debug #define.

2014-09-19
polargraph_server_a1 1.10.2
Thanks to billc and rincey12 for finding that penlift commands without height
parameters didn't work (https://github.com/euphy/polargraph_server_a1/issues/2).
This was a leftover bug from the switch from Strings to char-arrays. 

2014-09-17
polargraphcontroller 1.10.2
That line filtering thing... Er didn't really work. It mostly filtered EVERYTHING
out, and it's pretty rare you want that. I'll work on that another time.

2014-09-14
http://www.polargraph.co.uk/2014/09/significant-changes-to-uno-firmware/
polargraph_server_a1 1.10
Removed checksum from commands. Significant rework on the strings that are used for 
commands and params - now uses char arrays and atoi / atol / atof etc directly instead 
of Strings and the little helpers I wrote. This now leaves enough memory free to run
all the features at once, even with the AFMSv2 - great stuff. Comms protocol 
requires exactly one change in the controller:
polargraphcontroller 1.10
Added termination character at the end of the 'send command' function. This 
should always have been there - I assumed it was, but alas no. It's lack caused
problems, which were indirectly solved by the checksum boondoggle, but this fix should
make that less necessary.
Changed behaviour of vector drawing, so that when a line leaves the drawing area 
(like when the artwork is larger than the drawing frame, for instance), the machine 
lifts the pen, and drops it at the position where the line re-enters the frame. This 
makes for a kind of "borderless" effect. I found nested artworks ended up with a lot
of duplicated perimeters.

2014-08-02
http://www.polargraph.co.uk/2014/08/feedback-in-the-controller/
polargraph_server_polarshield 1.10
Added MSG string to some outgoing communications to allow the controller
to sensibly parse and display the message. Added a #define USE_LCD to be
able to turn off the touch-detection routines. They go a bit daft when there's 
no screen attached. I'm sure there's a way to detect if a screen is connected
automatically. But that's not happening yet.
polargraph_server_a1 1.9
As above, but slightly less verbose.
polargraphcontroller 1.9
Displays certain kinds of messages that come in from the connected machine. This is
a debugging feature really.

2014-08-01
polargraph_server_polarshield 1.9
Added 'ADJUST PENLIFT POSITION' feature on the touch UI.
Reinstated the screen saver timeout.
A host of fiddles to get things working on the new Polarshield v2 more reliably. 
The touch is no longer interrupt-driven.

polargraphcontroller 1.8
Added new pixel density preview styles. More realistic and AMAZING.

2014-05-25
polargraph_server_polarshield 1.8
Moved the motor and server pin declarations into preprocessor #defines, and introduced the concept of different MOTHERBOARDs, as in Marlin etc. Fairly certain I will regret this decision, but in the meantime, it makes it practical for folk to compile the firmware to run on RAMPS.

2014-03-12
polagraphcontroller 1.7.1
Ok thats a bit embarrassing. Made the change for v1.7, tested it, _removed it_, committed. Hm. It's back.

2014-03-10 
polargraphcontroller: 1.7
- Kongorilla and Nosetinker helped me to a solution to the Secret of the Gappy Drawings.
(http://www.polargraph.co.uk/forum/polargraphs-group2/troubleshooting-forum5/mind-the-gaps-thread222.0/)
- Made the serial port selection window a bit taller.

2014-02-02
polargraph_server_polarshield: 1.7.25
- Fixed the SD card filename loading. Added a second level "more" menu for the "adjust
pen lift" functions (as yet not existing). Drawing from file (on SD card) now also
echoes the commands to the front screen. Because this slows drawing down - because the LCD is slow - there is a feature under "more..." to mute it.

2014-02-01
polargraph_server_polarshield: 1.7.24
- Moved to semantic versioning. Changed the SD card init routines, and displayed progress
on screen during init too. This seems to have allowed one of my troublesome SD cards to
actually work.

2014-01-27
polargraph_server_polarshield: 1.7u23
- Made the 2.4" screen the default.
- Fixed a bug in the pixel drawing algorithm that overrode the density with 3. That uses the proper density now, but also it uses a slightly more efficiently structured pixel drawing
procedure too. Hopefully the output is the same. It saves a few bytes anyway. Issue 3.

2013-07-20
polargraph_server_polarshield: 1.7
- Small fix for issue where pen is not lifted between lines on the norwegian pixel.
- Added facility to use a 2.4 inch screen.  This is in the form of a pair of #defines
in the main file, one of which should be commented out. The 2.2 inch screen is still 
the default.

2013-05-12
polargraph_server_*: 1.66 (changed the version on mega back to being in sync)
- Corrected bad casting on floats in previous version, ha.

2013-05-11
polagraph_server_a1, polargraph_server_polarshield: 1.65, polargraph_server_mega: 1.7a
- Added casting to float when doing calculations that multiply longs.  

2013-05-09
polargraphcontroller: 1.6
- Removed live webcam feature, it now draws from the loaded image (bitmap).
Still a couple of quirks, but this is to get it out there.

2013-05-05
- Included WinVDIG 1.0.5 in the archive.

polargraph_server_a1: 1.63
- Fixed problem that meant that "currentlyRunning" was false, and so nothing
moved.  Duh.
- Moved copies of EEPROMAnything.h into sketch folders rather than have
it as a library.  Just feels better that way.

2013-04-30
polargraph_server_mega: 1.7a
- Contains beta stuff for a new swirling roving style.  It is the most infuriating
thing I have ever witnessed.

polargraph_server_a1: 1.62
- HA! Version for Arduino UNO.  This loads on an UNO, but is too large for a
Duemilanove.

Controller: 1.5
- Added a the swirl rove render buttons required to use the 1.7a firmware.

2013-04-27
Server: 1.62
- Fixed significant bug that caused vector lines (move direct / C17) to be finished
off with too much of a flourish.  It caused the drawing to get progressively higher 
and higher on the surface.  So that's not cool.  I could not replicate the issue
in polargraph_server_polarshield, only in polargraph_server_mega (using the adafruit
motorshield), so I'm a bit puzzled about what it is.  Anyway, I have also applied the
fix in p_s_polarshield.
- Changed pen lift height test so it ends with the pen up (lifted), rather than down.

Controller: 1.5
- Can buttons to rotate live webcam image, preview live and processed video
feed, flip video left to right.

2013-04-21
Server: 1.61
- EEPROM_anything is the general purpose eeprom saver/loader routine.  It alerted 
me that I was saving a float (which was four bytes) into an address that was
only two.  So it wasn't reloading properly.  So the addresses have been 
changed.  Note that you will need to upload your machine size again after loading this 
firmware.

Controller: 1.42
- Now possible to set picture frame size even if there is no image loaded.

2013-04-20
Server: 1.6
- Circular pixel (spiral) now working FAST.  Sorted out, and looking very
beautiful.  The acceleration profile can cause some problems when drawing very tiny circles, but fix by reducing acceleration.

Controller: 1.41
- Renamed circular pixel to spiral pixel.

2013-04-19
- Source code now being kept in github rather than google's SVN system.
https://github.com/euphy/polargraphcontroller
https://github.com/euphy/polargraph_server_polarshield
https://github.com/euphy/polargraph_server_mega

Though the google project page will be kept for the time being, and
downloads there will be maintained.

Controller: 1.4
- Added webcam feature to draw sketches from live video feed.  This
requires the wonderful Diewald CV kit library, written by Thomas Diewald.
This is available from http://thomasdiewald.com/processing/libraries/diewald_CV_kit/
- Added vector line sorting.  Standard sorting is "none", but longest first,
largest area first and centre-first are available internally.  Centre-first
was designed for the live drawer to allow the most important features to be 
drawn first, and background later.  Totally worked.
- Keyboard shortcuts now require "ctrl+" to work.  So ctrl-c for console.  Ctrl-i
for info, that kind of thing.  This is to prevent these things from being
triggered why trying to type into text fields.  That was driving me mental.
- Vector handle (for moving) is now in the centre of the shape, and resizing 
happens from the centre too.
- Return to home button.
- Pen lift positions configurable, with "test range" function.

Server: 1.5
- Pen lift positions are now configurable and can be saved to eeprom. The 
settings take the form of an up position and a down position.  The C13 and C14
commands now take an optional second parameter that sets the position to go to.
Setting it that way does NOT save to eeprom.
Pen lift code contributed by Andreas (Televio - http://www.polargraph.co.uk/
forum/?mingleforumaction=viewtopic&t=182), thanks!
- Pen lift range test function, C45 takes an up, down position and a third 
value to control if it is a test or a save.  If the value is 0, or missing,
then a range test is performed (just a back-and-forth wiggle to the chosen 
points) and the values set for that session.  IF the value is 1, then the
value is set in EEPROM too.
- Speed and acceleration can be saved to eeprom too now, with an optional
1 (save) parameter added to the regular set speed commands.  eg C31,<speed>,1,END.
- Comms is much faster.  I am a little suspicious of how safe it is, but I've 
not seen it fail, so fingers crossed.
- Fixed a problem introduced by a fix in v1.2x of AccelStepper, that made for
ridiculous vector drawing.  This fix may not be backwards compatible with 
older versions of AccelStepper (older than todays: 1.31).  But probably is.

Unfortunately this version no longer fits on an Arduino Duemilanove.  I think it 
might be a couple of extra features in accelstepper, but that might just be
scapegoating the brilliant Mike MacAuley, and it's probably my rubbish.  It 
might still fit on an UNO, but until I can test it, this distro contains only
updates for the MEGA based machines.  UNO owners should continue to use the
1.2x firmware, with an Accelstepper version 1.17.
